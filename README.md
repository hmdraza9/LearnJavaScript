Files Overview
File 1: Basic Math and Temperature Conversion
Functions:
add(n1, n2): Adds two numbers.
multiply(n1, n2): Multiplies two numbers.
tempConversion(str): Converts temperature between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Example Usage:
Basic arithmetic operations with add and multiply.
Converts temperature values in the format "3F" or "300K" and outputs the result in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
File 2: Comparison Utilities
Functions:
checkApprox(num1, num2, epsilon): Checks if two numbers are approximately equal within a given tolerance (epsilon).
checkEqual(num3, num4): Checks if two numbers are exactly equal.
Example Usage:
Checks approximate equality for floating-point numbers.
File 3: Object Manipulations and Nested Loops
Objects:
car: A sample object representing a car with properties for make, brand, and state.
movie and advMovie: Represent movie information with nested properties.
meals: Contains nested meal details (breakfast, lunch, dinner) with functions for generating meal descriptions.
Example Usage:
Modifies object properties and deletes specific keys.
Reads nested object properties and displays structured data in various formats.
File 4: Variable Manipulation and Math Operations
Variables:
Demonstrates basic arithmetic, assignment, and comparison operators.
Uses Math.pow for exponent calculations and various console.log statements for step-by-step output.
Examples:
Performs operations on a variable a to showcase incrementing, decrementing, and power functions.
Concatenates numbers and strings to show coercion in JavaScript.
File 5: Variable Scope and Reassignment
Constants and Variables:
Demonstrates the use of const, var, and let.
Shows immutability of constants and how var and let behave differently.
Functions:
getFirstNull: Finds and returns the first null argument from a list of arguments.
Example Usage:
Highlights variable reassignment with var and let, along with an error example for const.
